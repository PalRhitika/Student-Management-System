# Student Management System

A Django-based **Student Management System** developed as part of an **assessment task**.
This system manages **Students, Courses, Instructors, Enrollments, and Metadata**, following Djangoâ€™s **Modelâ€“Viewâ€“Template (MVT) architecture**.
It includes CRUD functionalities, basic authentication, search with pagination, and chart visualizations.



## Features
- Manage **Students, Courses, Instructors, and Enrollments**
- **Metadata support** for flexible extension of the model (key/value pairs)
- Search and pagination for list views
- Attractive **Bootstrap-based UI**
- Seed data for quick setup

---

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Django 5, Python 3
- **Frontend:** Django Templates with **Bootstrap 5** and **Chart.js**
- **Database:** SQLite (default, but configurable)
- **Authentication:** Django built-in authentication system
- **Other:** Custom Template Filters, Search with Pagination, Metadata system

   cd Student-Management-System
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # on Linux/Mac
   env/scripts/activate      # on Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Apply migrations**
   ```bash
   py manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Load seed data (dummy records)**
   ```bash
   python manage.py loaddata seed.json
   ```

6. **Create superuser**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Run the server**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8. Visit: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

##  Dummy Data
The project includes **seed.json** with:
- 10 Metadata records
- 10 Students
- 6 Courses
- 4 Instructors
- 15 Enrollments

Load anytime using:
```bash
python manage.py loaddata seed.json

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Experience / Reflection

Working on this assessment was a highly valuable experience. I got to deepen my understanding of **Djangoâ€™s MVT architecture, class-based views, template inheritance, and custom template filters**. Implementing CRUD operations, search, pagination, and chart visualizations allowed me to combine backend logic with frontend presentation effectively.

A big thank you to **NSDevil** for providing this assessment. I got a chance to  explore topics and areas I was previously unfamiliar with from which I learned a lot while building a practical, user-friendly Student Management System.
